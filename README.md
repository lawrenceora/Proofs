# Proofs

"Mathematics reveals its secrets only to those who approach it with pure love, for its own beauty."

A collection of the proofs I've written during my undergraduate. Most are from problem sets written for credit, while a small few were written just so I can convince someone they're wrong. I do my best to present the solutions as elegantly as I can, for doing otherwise is an injustice.
